The Harvester Helper will allow you to select the objects and generate the initial content for blog posts on the Idaho Harvester](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/). 


{% include feature/button.html link="post-generator.html" color="primary" size="lg" text="Generate a Post" %}
{% include feature/button.html link="post-generator.html" color="primary" size="lg" text="Generate an Include Command" %}

These pages provide two forms that will generate the correct code for [the frontmatter and content of a blog post](post-generator.html) as well as [the include command to include in a blog post](include-generator.html). An Include Command will "include" an object from the harvester digital collection or from our own digital collections.


We also link via the menu to the extensive documentation created on the [Wiki of the Harvester's github repository](https://github.com/uidaholib/spec-lumber/wiki).
